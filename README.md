# AES-Advanced-Encryption-Standard-implementation-in-Cpp-

I have implemented AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) in c++,which is a symmetric-key algorithm meaning it needs only key to encrypt and decrypt data.
The key need to be shared between the encrypter and decrypter.

I have followed the wikepedia page info about AES and implemented this.
